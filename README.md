# Maths & CS B.Sc. thesis
Here you can find an exact copy of my Mathematics and Computer Engineering B.Sc. thesis: *Code deobfuscation by program synthesis-aided simplification of Mixed Boolean-Arithmetic expressions*.

For the sake of completion, I attached the exact code and files that were submitted. However, if you are interested in r2syntia, you might want to go to https://github.com/arnaugamez/r2syntia where I uploaded a refined version and some basic notes on installation and usage.
